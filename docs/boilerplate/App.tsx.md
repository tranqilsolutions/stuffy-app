# App.tsx

`App.tsx` is the entry point for Expo / React Native itself. It is minimal on purpose - its only responsibiliy is to:

- Setup the Splash Screen
- Immediately load our app's root component

Not to be confused with [app/app.tsx](./app/app.tsx.md), which is the main root component that gets rendered.
