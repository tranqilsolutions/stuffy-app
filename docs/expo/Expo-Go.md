# Expo Go

When your app is simple and you don't need custom native platform code integrations, Expo Go is the easiest possible way to build a React Native / Ignite app. Ignite works great on Expo Go.

Expo Go is essentially a preconfigured native project that you can run on your phone and load locally hosted React Native projects into. It's easy to get started and there's very little setup required.

When you go to deploy to the App Store / Play Store, EAS (Expo Application Services) allows you to build your app in the cloud. No Xcode/Android Studio required!

However, if you want to use custom native code, you'll need to use Expo's [Continuous Native Generation](./CNG.md) workflow or [do it yourself](./DIY.md).
