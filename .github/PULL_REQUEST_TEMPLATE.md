## Please verify the following:

- [ ] `yarn test` **jest** tests pass with new tests, if relevant
- [ ] `yarn lint` **eslint** checks pass with new code, if relevant
- [ ] `yarn format:check` **prettier** checks pass with new code, if relevant
- [ ] `README.md` (or relevant documentation) has been updated with your changes
- [ ] If this affects functionality there aren't tests for, I manually tested it, including by generating a new app locally if needed ([see docs](https://docs.infinite.red/ignite-cli/contributing/Contributing-To-Ignite/#testing-changes-from-your-local-copy-of-ignite)).
